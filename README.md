## Project Overview

- Responsive Angular portfolio with Tailwind CSS.  
- Navigation between pages: Home, About, Skills, Projects, Contact.  
- Contact form securely sends messages via EmailJS.  
- API keys are managed via `.env` to prevent exposure on GitHub.

---

## Features

- **Home Page**: Quick introduction and welcome section.  
- **About Page**: Personal info, background, and summary.  
- **Skills Page**: List of technical skills.  
- **Projects Page**: Showcase of completed projects.  
- **Contact Page**: Form to send a message through EmailJS.

## EmailJS Integration

- The contact form uses EmailJS to send emails directly from the frontend.  
- All sensitive keys (Service ID, Template ID, Public Key) are stored in a `.env` file and injected into `src/environments/environment.ts` automatically using `set-env.js`.  
- This ensures that **private keys are never exposed on GitHub**.

---

## Environment Variables

The project uses a `.env` file at the root to store EmailJS keys securely:

```env
EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=your_service_id
EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=your_template_id
EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Important: Do not push .env to GitHub.
- src/environments/environment.ts is automatically generated by the set-env.js script and is included in .gitignore.

To generate environment.ts:
'node set-env.js'

This file will contain your EmailJS keys, pulled from .env, without exposing them on GitHub.
